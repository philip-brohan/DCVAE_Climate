name: DCVAE-Climate

# Updated 2025-02-06 to use only the conda-forge channel and to update cdsapi to use the new climate data store.
# Also updates various software packages to more recent versions.

channels:
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  # Basics
  - python=3.11
  - libwebp>=1.3.2 # Earlier versions have a security vulnerability
  - iris=3
  - pandas=2
  - cmocean=4
  - parallel
  - zarr=2
  # Older matplotlib - 3.10 screws up pcolorfast and background colour (why?)
  - matplotlib=3.9.2
  # GPU support - need these for tensorflow to pick up GPU versions
  - cuda
  - cudnn
  # Get data from ERA5
  # You'll need to register, see https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api-how-to
  - cdsapi>=0.7.2
  - nco=5 # Need ncks to fix broken CDS files
  # Optional, code formatter
  - black
  # Optional - documentation generator
  - sphinx

  # Some packages are only available via pip
  - pip
  - pip:
      - tensorflow
      # For bilinear interpolation
      - tensorflow-addons
      # For input space search
      - tensorflow-probability
      # Unused, but required by tfp?
      - tf-keras
      # For efficient data IO
      - tensorstore

# Tell python to look for modules in the root directory of the project
# (A hack, needs to be edited for every installation, but makes code
#  management much easier.)
# Replace with the path to your project directory root.

variables:
  PYTHONPATH: /home/users/philip.brohan/Projects/DCVAE_Climate

# Fix really weird error in scipy optimize (loaded by iris)
# This should be CONDA_ENVS_PATH/DCVAE-Climate/lib
#   but you canb'yt do variable expansion here - so set it for each system.
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH: /data/users/philip.brohan/conda/environments/DCVAE-Climate/lib
