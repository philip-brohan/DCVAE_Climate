Generic model specification file
================================

To instantiate a specific ML model, from the generic model design, we provide the inputs, outputs, and hyperparameters in a specification file.

To create a specific model, copy this file and the :doc:`training script (autoencoder.py) <training>` to a new directory, and modify the inputs, outputs, and hyperparameters as needed.

.. literalinclude:: ../../ML_models/default/specify.py
